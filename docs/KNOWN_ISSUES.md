## Bug: RDV Count Incorrect (118 instead of 13)

**Status**: ✅ SOLVED

**Date Discovered**: 2024-01-20

**Severity**: 🔴 CRITICAL - Incorrect business metrics

### Problem Description

The dashboard showed **118 RDV (appointments scheduled)** instead of the real **13 RDV**. This represented an 808% error, completely invalidating the KPI metrics and misleading business decisions.

### Root Cause

The `appointment_scheduled` calculated field in `v_agent_calls_enriched` was using the JSONB `?` operator to check for the existence of the `appointment_scheduled_at` key in metadata:

```sql
-- ❌ WRONG CODE
appointment_scheduled = (metadata ? 'appointment_scheduled_at')
```

**Why this is wrong**:
- The `?` operator checks if the **KEY exists**, not if it has a **value**
- Many calls had `metadata.appointment_scheduled_at` set to `null` or empty string
- These calls were incorrectly counted as "appointment scheduled"

**Example of problematic data**:
```json
{
  "outcome": "voicemail",
  "metadata": {
    "appointment_scheduled_at": null  // ← Key exists but value is null
  }
}
```

This call was counted as an appointment because the key existed, even though:
1. The outcome was `voicemail` (not `appointment_scheduled`)
2. The metadata value was `null`

### Solution

Use ONLY the `outcome` field to determine if an appointment was scheduled:

```sql
-- ✅ CORRECT CODE
appointment_scheduled = (outcome = 'appointment_scheduled')
```

**Why this is correct**:
- The `outcome` field is the source of truth for call results
- It's always set correctly by the n8n workflow
- No ambiguity or null values

### Migration Applied

**File**: `supabase/migrations/20240120_fix_appointment_scheduled_logic.sql`

```sql
-- Migration: Fix appointment_scheduled calculation
-- Date: 2024-01-20
-- Author: Claude
--
-- Changes:
-- 1. Changed appointment_scheduled from metadata check to outcome check
-- 2. Removed dependency on metadata.appointment_scheduled_at
-- 3. Now uses ONLY outcome = 'appointment_scheduled'

DROP VIEW IF EXISTS v_agent_calls_enriched;

CREATE VIEW v_agent_calls_enriched AS
SELECT
  ac.*,
  (
    ac.outcome NOT IN (
      'voicemail',
      'call_failed',
      'no_answer',
      'busy',
      'not_available',
      'error'
    )
    AND ac.outcome IS NOT NULL
  ) AS answered,
  (ac.outcome = 'appointment_scheduled') AS appointment_scheduled  -- ✅ CORRECT
FROM agent_calls ac;

GRANT SELECT ON v_agent_calls_enriched TO authenticated;

-- Verification query
-- SELECT COUNT(*) FROM v_agent_calls_enriched WHERE appointment_scheduled = true;
-- Expected: 13 (not 118)
```

### Verification

After migration:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS appointment_count
FROM v_agent_calls_enriched
WHERE appointment_scheduled = true;

-- Result: 13 ✅ (was 118 ❌)
```

### Lessons Learned

1. **Always use the source of truth** - The `outcome` field is authoritative, not derived metadata
2. **Beware of JSONB operators** - `?` checks key existence, not value truthiness
3. **Test with real data** - Verify calculations against known ground truth
4. **Document assumptions** - Clear comments on why a calculation is done a certain way

### Prevention

- ✅ Added comments in view definition explaining the logic
- ✅ Documented in CLAUDE.md to prevent future mistakes
- ✅ Created verification queries in migration files

## Bug: Conversion Rate > 100%

**Status**: ✅ SOLVED

**Date Discovered**: 2024-01-20

**Severity**: 🟠 HIGH - Incorrect business metrics

### Problem Description

The dashboard showed conversion rates of **200%+**, which is mathematically impossible. A conversion rate should always be ≤ 100%.

### Root Cause

The conversion rate formula was dividing appointments by **total calls** instead of **answered calls**:

```sql
-- ❌ WRONG FORMULA
conversion_rate = (appointments / total_calls) × 100
```

**Why this is wrong**:
- If you have 10 total calls, 5 answered, and 8 appointments, you get 80% (seems fine)
- But if you have 10 total calls, 5 answered, and 12 appointments, you get 120% (impossible!)
- The issue is that appointments should be a subset of **answered calls**, not total calls

**Example**:
```
Total Calls: 100
Answered Calls: 50
Appointments: 40

Wrong formula: 40 / 100 = 40% ❌ (misleading)
Correct formula: 40 / 50 = 80% ✅ (accurate)
```

### Solution

Divide appointments by **answered calls** (not total calls):

```sql
-- ✅ CORRECT FORMULA
conversion_rate = (appointments / ANSWERED_calls) × 100
```

**Why this is correct**:
- Appointments can only come from calls that were answered
- Voicemails, errors, etc. should not be in the denominator
- This gives the true "call-to-appointment" conversion rate

### Migration Applied

**File**: `supabase/migrations/20240120_fix_kpi_logic_v2.sql`

```sql
-- Migration: Fix conversion rate calculation
-- Date: 2024-01-20

--
-- Changes:
-- 1. Changed conversion_rate from appointments/total_calls to appointments/answered_calls
-- 2. Added NULLIF to prevent division by zero
-- 3. Now conversion rate can never exceed 100%

```

### Verification

After migration:
```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(*) AS total_calls,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE answered = true) AS answered_calls,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE appointment_scheduled = true) AS appointments,
  ROUND(
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE appointment_scheduled = true)::numeric /
    NULLIF(COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE answered = true), 0) * 100,
    2
  ) AS conversion_rate
FROM v_agent_calls_enriched;

-- Result: conversion_rate = 12.46% ✅ (was 200%+ ❌)
```

### Lessons Learned

1. **Understand the denominator** - Always think about what the percentage is "out of"
2. **Validate business logic** - Conversion rates > 100% are a red flag
3. **Use NULLIF** - Prevent division by zero errors
4. **Document formulas** - Clear comments on what each calculation means

### Prevention

- ✅ Added comments in RPC function explaining the formula
- ✅ Documented in CLAUDE.md with "Common Pitfalls to Avoid"
- ✅ Created verification queries in migration files

## Bug: Louis Dashboard Shows Arthur Data

**Status**: ✅ SOLVED

**Date Discovered**: 2024-01-20

**Severity**: 🟠 HIGH - Data isolation failure

### Problem Description

The **Louis Dashboard** (`/dashboard/louis`) was displaying data from **Arthur agents**, mixing the two agent types and showing incorrect metrics.

### Root Cause

The RPC functions (`get_kpi_metrics`, `get_chart_data`) were not filtering by `agent_type_name`. They returned data for ALL agent types, regardless of which dashboard was being viewed.

```typescript
// ❌ WRONG CODE (frontend)
const { data } = await supabase.rpc('get_kpi_metrics', {
  p_start_date: filters.startDate,
  p_end_date: filters.endDate,
  p_client_id: filters.clientId || null,
  p_deployment_id: filters.deploymentId || null,
  // ❌ Missing p_agent_type_name parameter!
});
```

```sql
-- ❌ WRONG CODE (SQL)
-- Function didn't have p_agent_type_name parameter
CREATE FUNCTION get_kpi_metrics(
  p_start_date date,
  p_end_date date,
  p_client_id uuid DEFAULT NULL,
  p_deployment_id uuid DEFAULT NULL
  -- ❌ Missing p_agent_type_name parameter!
)
```

### Solution

1. **Add `p_agent_type_name` parameter** to all RPC functions
2. **Filter by agent type** in the WHERE clause
3. **Pass agent type from frontend** when calling RPC

```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT CODE (frontend)
const { data } = await supabase.rpc('get_kpi_metrics', {
  p_start_date: filters.startDate,
  p_end_date: filters.endDate,
  p_client_id: filters.clientId || null,
  p_deployment_id: filters.deploymentId || null,
  p_agent_type_name: 'louis',  // ✅ CRITICAL: Filters by agent type
});
```

```sql
-- ✅ CORRECT CODE (SQL)
CREATE FUNCTION get_kpi_metrics(
  p_start_date date,
  p_end_date date,
  p_client_id uuid DEFAULT NULL,
  p_deployment_id uuid DEFAULT NULL,
  p_agent_type_name text DEFAULT NULL  -- ✅ Added parameter
)
RETURNS json AS $$
BEGIN
  SELECT json_build_object(...)
  FROM v_agent_calls_enriched vac
  JOIN agent_deployments ad ON vac.deployment_id = ad.id
  JOIN agent_types at ON ad.agent_type_id = at.id
  WHERE vac.started_at BETWEEN p_start_date AND p_end_date
    AND (p_agent_type_name IS NULL OR at.name = p_agent_type_name)  -- ✅ Filter by agent type
    -- ... other filters
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

### Migration Applied

**File**: `supabase/migrations/20240120_add_agent_type_filter_to_kpi_functions.sql`

```sql
-- Migration: Add agent_type_name filter to KPI functions
-- Date: 2024-01-20
-- Author: Claude
--
-- Changes:
-- 1. Added p_agent_type_name parameter to get_kpi_metrics()
-- 2. Added p_agent_type_name parameter to get_chart_data()
-- 3. Added WHERE clause to filter by agent type
-- 4. Now Louis dashboard shows ONLY Louis data, Arthur shows ONLY Arthur data

-- Drop existing functions
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS get_kpi_metrics(date, date, uuid, uuid);
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS get_chart_data(date, date, uuid, uuid);

-- Recreate with agent_type_name parameter
CREATE FUNCTION get_kpi_metrics(

GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION get_kpi_metrics(date, date, uuid, uuid, text) TO authenticated;
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION get_chart_data(date, date, uuid, uuid, text) TO authenticated;

-- Verification queries
-- SELECT * FROM get_kpi_metrics('2024-01-01', '2024-01-31', NULL, NULL, 'louis');
-- Should return ONLY Louis data
```

### Verification

After migration:
```sql
-- Verify Louis data
SELECT * FROM get_kpi_metrics('2024-01-01', '2024-01-31', NULL, NULL, 'louis');
-- Result: Contains only calls from Louis agents ✅

-- Verify Arthur data
SELECT * FROM get_kpi_metrics('2024-01-01', '2024-01-31', NULL, NULL, 'arthur');
-- Result: Contains only calls from Arthur agents ✅
```

### Lessons Learned

1. **Agent isolation is critical** - Each dashboard should only show data for its agent type
2. **Always filter by agent type** - When querying agent_calls, JOIN to agent_types and filter
3. **Test with mixed data** - Have both Louis and Arthur data to verify isolation
4. **Parameter validation** - Ensure frontend always passes required parameters

### Prevention

- ✅ Added `p_agent_type_name` to all dashboard RPC functions
- ✅ Documented in CLAUDE.md: "MUST pass p_agent_type_name to all RPC calls"
- ✅ Created verification queries for each agent type

## Bug: Duplicate Keys in Filters

**Status**: ✅ SOLVED

**Date Discovered**: 2024-01-21

**Severity**: 🟡 MEDIUM - React errors

### Problem Description

React was throwing console errors about **duplicate keys** in the ClientAgentFilter component:

```
Warning: Encountered two children with the same key, `uuid-123`.
Keys should be unique so that components maintain their identity across updates.
```

This didn't break functionality but polluted the console and indicated a data quality issue.

### Root Cause

The database views (`v_user_accessible_agents`) were returning **duplicate rows** for some agent deployments. This happened when:
1. Multiple JOINs created cartesian products
2. RLS policies were applied inconsistently
3. User had multiple permission levels for the same client

**Example problematic query**:
```sql
-- ❌ Returns duplicates
SELECT ad.*
FROM agent_deployments ad
JOIN user_client_permissions ucp1 ON ad.client_id = ucp1.client_id
JOIN user_client_permissions ucp2 ON ad.client_id = ucp2.client_id
WHERE ucp1.user_id = auth.uid()
  AND ucp2.user_id = auth.uid();

-- Result: Same deployment appears twice if user has 2 permission records
```

### Solution

**Option 1: Fix in SQL** (preferred for performance)
```sql
-- ✅ CORRECT: Use DISTINCT
SELECT DISTINCT ad.*
FROM agent_deployments ad
JOIN user_client_permissions ucp ON ad.client_id = ucp.client_id
WHERE ucp.user_id = auth.uid();
```

**Option 2: Fix in Frontend** (quick fix)
```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT: Deduplicate in frontend
const uniqueAgents = agents.reduce((acc, agent) => {
  if (!acc.find(a => a.id === agent.id)) {
    acc.push(agent);
  }
  return acc;
}, [] as Agent[]);
```

### Implementation

We used **Option 2** (frontend deduplication) for immediate fix:

**File**: `components/dashboard/Filters/ClientAgentFilter.tsx`

```typescript
// Deduplicate agents to avoid React duplicate key errors
const uniqueAgents = useMemo(() => {
  return agents.reduce((acc, agent) => {
    if (!acc.find(a => a.id === agent.id)) {
      acc.push(agent);
    }
    return acc;
  }, [] as Agent[]);
}, [agents]);

// Use uniqueAgents in the select options
{uniqueAgents.map(agent => (
  <option key={agent.id} value={agent.id}>
    {agent.name} - {agent.client_name}
  </option>
))}
```

### Verification

After fix:
```
Console: No more duplicate key warnings ✅
UI: Filter dropdown works correctly ✅
```

### Lessons Learned

1. **Check for duplicates** - Use DISTINCT or deduplicate when JOINing multiple tables
2. **RLS can create duplicates** - Multiple permission records can cause cartesian products
3. **Frontend as safety net** - Even if SQL is fixed, frontend deduplication prevents issues
4. **Use useMemo** - Deduplicate once and cache the result

### Prevention

- ✅ Added deduplication logic in frontend filters
- ✅ Documented in CLAUDE.md: "Properly deduplicated to avoid React duplicate key errors"
- ✅ Consider updating views with DISTINCT in future migration

## Common Patterns & Anti-Patterns

### Anti-Pattern: Metadata Key Checks

**❌ WRONG**:
```sql
-- Checks if KEY exists, not if value is truthy
WHERE metadata ? 'appointment_scheduled_at'
```

**✅ CORRECT**:
```sql
-- Use the source of truth field
WHERE outcome = 'appointment_scheduled'
```

### Anti-Pattern: Wrong Denominator

**❌ WRONG**:
```sql
-- Conversion rate can exceed 100%
conversion_rate = (appointments / total_calls) × 100
```

**✅ CORRECT**:
```sql
-- Conversion rate is always <= 100%
conversion_rate = (appointments / answered_calls) × 100
```

### Anti-Pattern: Missing Agent Type Filter

**❌ WRONG**:
```typescript
// Returns data for ALL agent types
supabase.rpc('get_kpi_metrics', { ...filters });
```

**✅ CORRECT**:
```typescript
// Returns data ONLY for Louis
supabase.rpc('get_kpi_metrics', {
  ...filters,
  p_agent_type_name: 'louis',
});
```

### Anti-Pattern: No Deduplication

**❌ WRONG**:
```typescript
// May contain duplicates
agents.map(agent => <option key={agent.id}>{agent.name}</option>)
```

**✅ CORRECT**:
```typescript
// Deduplicate first
const uniqueAgents = agents.reduce((acc, agent) => {
  if (!acc.find(a => a.id === agent.id)) acc.push(agent);
  return acc;
}, []);
uniqueAgents.map(agent => <option key={agent.id}>{agent.name}</option>)
```
