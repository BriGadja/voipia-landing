-- Migration: Add agent type filtering to KPI and chart functions
-- Description: Ensures Louis dashboard shows ONLY Louis data, Arthur shows ONLY Arthur data
-- Date: 2025-01-20
-- Author: Claude
--
-- Problem: get_kpi_metrics and get_chart_data were returning ALL agents (Louis + Arthur)
-- Solution: Add p_agent_type_name parameter to filter by agent type

-- ==============================================================================
-- STEP 1: DROP EXISTING FUNCTIONS
-- ==============================================================================

DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS get_kpi_metrics(DATE, DATE, UUID, UUID);
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS get_chart_data(DATE, DATE, UUID, UUID);


-- ==============================================================================
-- STEP 2: CREATE get_kpi_metrics WITH AGENT TYPE FILTER
-- ==============================================================================

  p_start_date DATE,
  p_end_date DATE,
  p_client_id UUID DEFAULT NULL,
  p_deployment_id UUID DEFAULT NULL,
