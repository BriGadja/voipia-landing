-- Description: Creates a view that adds calculated columns without modifying the base table

-- This migration:
-- 1. Creates v_agent_calls_enriched view with calculated answered and appointment_scheduled
-- 2. Does NOT modify the agent_calls table
-- 3. Keeps all data logic in SQL views and functions

-- VIEW: v_agent_calls_enriched
-- Description: Enriched view of agent_calls with calculated boolean columns
-- Purpose: Add answered and appointment_scheduled without modifying base table
